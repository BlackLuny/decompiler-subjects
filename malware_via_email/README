Description:
  These executable were sent as email attachments without request to
  Raimar Falke. In most cases these are worms, trojans and
  viruses. While the original source code and the author remain
  unknown these programs may provide some an interesting play field
  for decompiler. Note that the programs are sorted by increasing
  size.
